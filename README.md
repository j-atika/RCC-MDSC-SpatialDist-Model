# Introduction 
The spatial distribution of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) within the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumor microenvironment is critical for understanding the immunosuppressive mechanisms that contribute to tumor progression. The current Deep Learning models possess limitations when it comes to interpreting the given datas and scalability. Research has shown that MDSCs accumulate in the periphery of RCC tumors and are associated with poor prognosis [1]. Additionally, the presence of MDSCs within the tumor mass has been linked to resistance to immunotherapy [2]. 
Understanding the spatial distribution of MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment may provide insight into potential therapeutic targets for RCC. For instance, targeting the chemokine receptors that attract MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment may reduce their accumulation and mitigate their immunosuppressive effects [3]. 
Current methods for analyzing the spatial distribution of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumor microenvironment (TME) are limited and often rely on manual counting, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, the development of new methods for analyzing the spatial distribution of MDSCs within the TME is necessary for a better understanding of their role in RCC progression and for the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.
One promising approach is the use of image analysis software to quantify the density and location of MDSCs within RCC tumors [4]. This allows for a more objective and reproducible analysis of MDSC distribution within the TME. Other methods such as multiplex immunofluorescence staining and imaging mass cytometry have also been used to study the spatial distribution of immune cells in the TME [5,6].

# Research Question 
How does the deep-learning based model ameliorate the analysis of spatial transcriptomics distribution of myeloid-derived suppressor cells within the tumor microenvironment impact the efficacy of immunotherapy in Renal Cell Carcinoma?
